Implement hash set data structure to use in slf_coloring function and vertices_eccentrity
Left Right planarity test algorithm for planarity testing
Quicksort for faster sorting in some algorithm
Sparse Matrix data structure for calculatin C4 subgraphs
Optionally implementing Strassen's matrix multiplication algorithm, but sparse matrix should be better for graphs
