#Crack Engine
This project was never completed, I keep it so the code will remain maybe for future  

I used [Rastertek](https://www.rastertek.com/tutdx11.html) tutorial, but it seems to be a little bit outdated (it really is, now we can find dx win 10 tutorial), DirectX 11 contains many new header files, while the old ones are not available
Also i didn't understand many concepts from this tutorial, that's why i abandoned this project for now, i want to gain some new skills and find better source of knowledge
for learing DirectX, to understand basic concepts behind graphics engines

Idk if this code compiles, it should compile with some changes, and should display interpolarized triangle
