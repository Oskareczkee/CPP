# Path Finder
Project written as an assignment job. It main purpose was to create algorithm that can find the shortest path from point A to point B. This project contains implementation of 2 algorithms to solve the problem. It also uses
hand-written data structures including **RB Tree**, **Vector**, **Priority Queue** and **String**

# Algorithms and Containers
## Dijkstra
Dijkstra's algorithm was the first approach to solve the problem. While it solved the problem and was easy to implement, it did not pass time constraints. This is because Dijkstra's algorithm finds 
all possible paths from every point to every point, which resulted in a lot of computation
