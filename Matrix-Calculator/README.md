# Matrix Calculator
Simple Matrix calculator written as project for college. It allows to perform most important operations on matrices. I would rather consider this program as easter egg on this repo, rather than usable program

## Supported operations
- Add
- Subtract
- Multiply
- Transpose

All operations can be performed on any size matrices, you can simply change size of your matrix, or data it contains
